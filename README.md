Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

This Python script is a basic web application vulnerability scanner that incorporates various tools and checks for potential security issues. It includes checks for common vulnerabilities, runs Nmap scans, and attempts exploitation for specific vulnerabilities.

Prerequisites
Python 3
Nmap
Metasploit (for EternalBlue exploitation)
Ensure you have the required tools installed on your system before running the script.

Usage
Clone the repository:


Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the directory:


Copy code
cd web-vulnerability-scanner
Run the script:


Copy code
python vulnerability_scanner.py
Enter the target domain or IP address when prompted.

Follow the on-screen instructions. The script will perform Nmap scans, run various vulnerability checks, and prompt you for exploitation attempts.

Note: Ensure you have explicit authorization before attempting any exploitation.

Additional Notes
The script utilizes external tools such as Nmap, sqlmap, OWASP ZAP, XSSer, and others for vulnerability scanning.
The EternalBlue exploit requires Metasploit to be installed and properly configured.
